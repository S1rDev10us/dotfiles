My personal NixOS configuration.

If you want to try it out you need to create a `settings.json` file and then apply the schema from `settingsSchema.json` to it and fill out the required fields.

This configuration is constantly in development and may also not reflect the current state of my config.

Feel free to take elements and inspiration from this config in order to create your own 

| Hostname | Environment | Usecase | State | Hardware name |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|  hi  |  |


## Features

- Individual configs for different machines by customizing data in the hosts folder
- Update home manager and nixos together or separately



## Inspirations

A few of the configs that I've taken ideas from include:
- [nmasur](https://github.com/nmasur/dotfiles)
- [wimpysworld](https://github.com/wimpysworld/nix-config)
- [donovanglover](https://github.com/donovanglover/nix-config)
- [hlissner](https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles)
- [pinpox](https://github.com/pinpox/nixos)
- [fufexan](https://github.com/fufexan/dotfiles)



No doubt I've missed a few from when I was first getting into nix but I am thankful to everyone who left their config on the internet for me to learn from.
