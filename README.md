## Repo description

This repo contains the dotfiles for my NixOS config.

If you want to try it out you need to create a new host and potentially a new user account and then run `just switch`

This configuration is constantly in development and may also not reflect the current state of my config.

Feel free to take elements and inspiration from this config in order to create your own

## Structure

There are two config directories for each user in a system.

They have a set of options that are only applied when using home manager and a set of options that are applied when using NixOS and home manager

The home manager specific configuration is in ./users/${user}/default.nix and the shared system config is in ./hosts/${host}/default.nix

Those options are not evaluated by the usual home manager or nix modules system,
instead they are evaluated ahead of time.
This means that that config's settings can be used to get the `stateVersion`
(and potentially the system architecture in the future)

Modules for nixos and home manager as well as shared modules are stored in the `modules` folder (under the `nix`, `home` and `common` folders respectively)

The options for the aforementioned system config are stored in the `options` directory and are recursively gathered.
The options that they generate are documented [below](#host-config-options)

The NixOS and home manager configs also gather a few specific files for their config so that
if you need to specify configuration that is unique to that computer or user then
you can do so.

These files are:

- Home manager:
  - `./users/${user}/home.nix`
  - `./hosts/${host}/home.nix`
- NixOS:
  - `./hosts/${host}/configuration.nix`
  - `./hosts/${host}/hardware-configuration.nix`

Modules in system specific files cannot affect the main system options and the config for the options can't control the systems directly

The overall structure of the system is as follows:

(Modules with ! aren't optional, modules with \_ are home manager specific and modules with - are NixOS specific)

## Features

- Individual configs for different machines by customizing data in the hosts folder
- Update home manager and nixos together or separately

## Host config options

- `stateVersion` = a string that is used for the stateVersion
- `coding.enable` = enable generic code editors
- `environment`
  - `hyprland.enable` = enable hyprland
  - `gnome.enable` = enable gnome
- `fun.enable` = enable fun tools like [eDex ui](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/tree/v2.2.8)
- `gamedev.enable` = enable game development tools
- `gaming.enable` = enable games
- `GUI.enable` = enable GUI packages
- `WSL.enable` = enable WSL support
- `VM.enable` = enable vm support

No doubt I've missed a few from when I was first getting into nix but I am thankful to everyone who left their config on the internet for me to learn from.
