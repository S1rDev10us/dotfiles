# S1rDev10us-NixOS-Configuration

My personal NixOS configuration.

If you want to try it out you need to create a `settings.json` file and then apply the schema from `settingsSchema.json` to it and fill out the required fields.

This configuration is constantly in development and may also not reflect the current state of my config.

Feel free to take elements and inspiration from this config in order to create your own however it is probably inadvisable to use it as is because the system is made by me for me and my machines.
