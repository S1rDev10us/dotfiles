- [ ] See if I can do anything about specialisations
  - If I'm making a specialisation per DE I could loop over the list of all DEs and create specialisations if more than one is enabled
  - Alternatively I could probably add in my implementation of the specialisation option in my modules system and then integrate that into the Nix specialisation option
