    - [ ] Network manager

    - [ ] Doas
  - [ ] Convert those settings to modules
  - [ ] Create options for those modules
- [ ] Disable logging into root and add a local admin account
- [ ] setup plymouth
- [ ] Configure user accounts under `users.users.${name}.whatever`
  - I could go back to the old way of extending the host config with the user config
  - Because then I could generate an option for each user and then only if it is enabled do I add the configuration.nix from the user
  - [ ] Create an option for each user
  - [ ] If the option is enabled add configuration.nix from that folder to the config
    - [ ] Automatically create the user using `users.users.${user}`
- [ ] Try getting stylix to work again
  - [ ] If not could I make my own version or something?

- [ ] Add missing packages to system with relevant options
  - [ ] Discord
  - [ ] KeePassXC
  - [ ] Obsidian
    - [ ] Check if it still needs to be in unstable because of the electron issue
  - [ ] Neovim
    - [ ] Neovide (Terminals are better on linux. Will this be needed there?)
    - [ ] Neovim settings/config
- [ ] See if I can do anything about specialisations
  - If I'm making a specialisation per DE I could loop over the list of all DEs and create specialisations if more than one is enabled
  - Alternatively I could probably add in my implementation of the specialisation option in my modules system and then integrate that into the Nix specialisation option
